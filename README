  ICFPC TBD team repository

 --- Instructions ---

python (preferably 32-bit version)
setuptools
easy_install numpy, psyco (optional)
eclipse, pydev

--

Eclipse projects correspong directories in repo (probably, top level directories only)
But eclipse workspace itself is not in repo (that's why I added .metadata in gitignore)
